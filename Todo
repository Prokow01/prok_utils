List:
    - Create an install directory for plugin install scripts and whatnot
    - create script for homebrew:
            [] check installation / install
            [] add Cask

    - Create Cask list and automated install for that
    - Create individual homebrew install scripts for certain tools : pip, python etc.
    - Create Master / Guest install script for either full profile install or just tools to use on others computers
