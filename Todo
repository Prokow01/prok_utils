List:
    - Create an install directory for plugin install scripts and whatnot
    - create script for homebrew:
            [ ] check installation / install
            [x] add Cask

    - Create Master / Guest install script for either full profile install or just tools to use on others computers    
    - Add proxy stuff to append certain proxy information to all brew:
        precede any command with :
            http_proxy=http...proxy:port

RESOLVE:
    - Git_aware adds to the bash_profile, which edits the dotfiles/bash_profile... find a way to toggle this so that the intial bash_profile doesn't come with extra junk..
    [SOLUTION]
        - Create a file to source in the bash_profile.dotfile which has the git configurations...
